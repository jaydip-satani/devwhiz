    "content": "SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate databases. It allows you to perform operations such as retrieving data, updating records, and creating new tables. Letâ€™s explore the basic concepts of SQL.\n\n## Basic SQL Commands\n\nSQL commands are categorized into different types based on their functionality. Here are some of the most important ones:\n\n1. **SELECT**: Used to retrieve data from a database.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```\n\nThis will select all records from the `users` table.\n\n2. **INSERT**: Used to add new data into a table.\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25);\n```\n\n3. **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing data.\n\n```sql\nUPDATE users SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'John';\n```\n\n4. **DELETE**: Used to delete data from a table.\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM users WHERE age < 18;\n```\n\n## Data Types in SQL\n\nSQL supports various data types such as:\n\n- **INT**: For storing integers.\n- **VARCHAR**: For variable-length strings.\n- **DATE**: For storing date values.\n\nExample of creating a table with different data types:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n  id INT,\n  name VARCHAR(50),\n  hire_date DATE\n);\n```\n\n## Filtering Data with WHERE\n\nYou can filter data using the `WHERE` clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;\n```\n\nThis retrieves all users older than 18.\n\n## Joins in SQL\n\nJoins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Example of an inner join:\n\n```sql\nSELECT users.name, orders.amount\nFROM users\nINNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSQL is a powerful language for interacting with databases. By mastering SELECT queries, filtering, joins, and other essential SQL commands, you'll be able to work with data efficiently.",
