    "content": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of web pages. It allows you to change the layout, colors, fonts, and more. Letâ€™s explore the basics.\n\n## Syntax of CSS\n\nA CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. For example:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  color: blue;\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n```\n\nThis will make all `<h1>` elements blue and set the font size to 24 pixels.\n\n## Selectors in CSS\n\nCSS selectors target HTML elements to apply styles. Here are some common ones:\n\n1. **Element Selector**: Targets all elements of a specific type:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class:\n\n```css\n.text-bold {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n3. **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a unique ID:\n\n```css\n#main-header {\n  background-color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n## Box Model in CSS\n\nThe box model is essential in understanding CSS layout. Every HTML element is treated as a box, consisting of margins, borders, padding, and content.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCSS provides immense power to control the appearance of web pages. By mastering selectors, the box model, and styling techniques, you can create visually appealing and responsive websites.",
